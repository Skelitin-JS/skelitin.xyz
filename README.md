# skelitin.xyz

Welcome to the source code for skelitin.xyz!

Skelitin.xyz is now up, and fully functional.

Simply go into your browser of choice, and search "skelitin.xyz"

Or, go to this link: https://skelitin.xyz/

If there is anything not working, it is probably just being tested out by me.

I made this site to get better, and to learn HTML, css and maybe some javascript.

I originally coded the base of the site, but FrenchCat made the design much better.

French cat also implemented the webretro, or the g4mes tab.

If you would like to be shouted out for whatever reason, contact skelitinsite@gmail.com

Thank you!
